### Introduction

This project sets out to examine the well known Fisher's Iris data set <sup>[1](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)</sup>, through a review of existing research on the data set and an analysis of the data set using Python from which conclusions will be drawn.

### Fisher's Iris data set

#### The who, what, when, where and why

As this project is inspired by Fisher's Iris data set let us first look at what the data set is and how it was compiled.

##### Who

Ronald Fisher (17 February 1890 â€“ 29 July 1962), is considered one of the most important statistician of the twentieth century <sup>[2](https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/33146)</sup>. During his lifetime Fisher developed much of the theory behind modern statistics and a range of statistical tests still used today - such as the analysis of variance, ANOVA for short. However, Fisher's work was not limited to the field of mathematics. A founding member of the Cambridge University Eugenics Society, Fisher published numerous papers in the field of genetics exploring the inheritance of continuous traits, (which lay the foundations for his later work on variance), and the basis for population genetics, which examines the genetic differences within and between populations as part of evolutionary biology (*Ibid.*). 

In 1936, as Head of the Department of Eugenics at University College, London, Fisher developed a statistical tool to establish if a set of oberservations is effective in predicting membership of a category <sup>[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x)</sup>. Fisher illustrated the use of this statistical method with a data set compiled by botanist Edgar Anderson - the classic Iris data set <sup>[4](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2394164)</sup>.

### Introduction

This project sets out to examine the well known Fisher's Iris data set <sup>[1](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)</sup>, through a review of existing research on the data set and an analysis of the data set using Python from which conclusions will be drawn.

### Fisher's Iris data set

As this project is inspired by Fisher's Iris data set let us first look at what the data set is and how it was compiled.

Ronald Fisher (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962), is considered one of the most important statistician of the twentieth century <sup>[2](https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/33146)</sup>. During his lifetime Fisher developed much of the theory behind modern statistics and a range of statistical tests still used today - such as the analysis of variance, ANOVA for short. However, Fisher's work was not limited to the field of mathematics. A founding member of the Cambridge University Eugenics Society, Fisher published numerous papers in the field of genetics exploring the inheritance of continuous traits, (which lay the foundations for his later work on variance), and the basis for population genetics, which examines the genetic differences within and between populations as part of evolutionary biology (*Ibid.*). 

In 1936, as Head of the Department of Eugenics at University College, London, Fisher developed a statistical tool to establish if a set of observations is effective in predicting membership of a category <sup>[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x)</sup>. Fisher illustrated the use of this statistical method with a data set compiled by botanist Edgar Anderson - the classic Iris data set <sup>[4](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2394164)</sup>.

The tool developed by Fisher (the linear discriminant function – generalised to linear discriminant analysis or LDA<sup>[5]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis)</sup>, is a multivariable statistical analysis technique for determining whether an object can be assigned to a predefined class on the basis of measured values (Butterfield, A. et. al, 2016). That is it looks at a set of observations for a category and seeks to identify predictors, or indicators, of that category. Applying these predictors to other samples ought to help determine if the samples fall into that category.
  
To achieve this a number of techniques are employed.

Fisher’s linear discriminant, as a multivariate tool, analyses data derived from multiple variables. Unlike univariate tools, which consider one variable - and only allow for descriptive analysis - multivariate tools support descriptive analysis of variables and analysis and exploration of the relationship between the variables (*Ibid.*).

By examining all of the available information from multiple variables at the same time Fisher’s linear discriminant projects the mean of each set of variables (class). The distance between the means presents the maximum separation between classes (the further the distance between means the greater the difference between classes). In addition to identifying the maximum variance between classes Fisher’s model also determines the minimum variance within each class so the similarities of each class can be characterised<sup>[7]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis)</sup>.

From this analysis, we see both the differences and commonalities of the provided variables and the relationships between them. Exploring the variables in this way recognises the characteristics of each class which can be used to predict the possibility of an object being classified within a given group or category.
